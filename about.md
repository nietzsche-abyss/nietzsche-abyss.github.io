![About Me](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Nietzsche187a.jpg)

Hi, I'm Markus, a passionate malware researcher, cybersecurity specialist, and tech enthusiast. 

To delve into the abyss of systems, to confront the unseen forces lurking in the shadows of macOS and Linux—this is my pursuit. I do not merely study malware; I dismantle its very essence, tracing the veins of its creation to expose its vulnerabilities. In the dance between attacker and defender, I choose the path of red teaming, where power is claimed through understanding and mastery of the unseen. My craft is not a task, but a confrontation with the unknown, and in that confrontation, I become stronger.

Feel free to explore my blog for technical insights, tutorials, and personal projects. I'm excited to share my journey and connect with like-minded individuals!
